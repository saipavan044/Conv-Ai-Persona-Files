Hello, I'm Sneha Devi, a 33-year-old React Developer from Chennai, India. Currently employed at Sify Technologies, I specialize in the MERN stack and possess a strong grasp of cloud concepts. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from IIT Chennai, I've accumulated a diverse range of experiences, including roles at TechGenix Solutions and CloudWave Innovations.

My childhood was marked by building computers with my father and participating in coding competitions with friends Priya and Rohan. Professionally, I overcame shyness to lead the development of a complex e-commerce platform. I'm passionate about sustainable living, enjoy reading and playing the guitar, and find solace in the Himalayas.

In my technical toolkit, I'm proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB and MySQL. My dreams include contributing to open-source projects and starting a tech education initiative for underprivileged children. Despite being introverted, I bring empathy, adaptability, and innovation to both my professional and personal life. My motto: "Code speaks louder than words."
